# Mgrid - Grid solution for PHP 5

Mgrid generates for you a optimal and handy grid.

## Instalation

The recommended way to install Mgrid is [through
composer](http://getcomposer.org). Just create a `composer.json` file and
run the `php composer.phar install` command to install it:

    {
        "require": {
            "mdn/mgrid": "dev-master"
        }
    }

Alternatively, you can download the [`mgrid.zip`][1] file and extract it.

## Usage

At the moment this grid is only available to go with Zend Framework 1.x. 
We are working to try to make it as universal as possible.
